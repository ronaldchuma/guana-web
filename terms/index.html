      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="updated">Last updated: February 16, 2026</p>

      <p>Welcome to Guana. By using our app, you agree to these terms. Please read them carefully.</p>

      <h2>1. The Service</h2>
      <p>Guana is a ride-sharing platform that connects drivers and passengers traveling across Costa Rica. We facilitate connections between users but are not a transportation provider. Guana does not own vehicles, employ drivers, or provide transportation services.</p>

      <h2>2. Your Account</h2>
      <p>To use Guana, you must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be at least 18 years old</li>
        <li>Create an account with a valid email address</li>
        <li>Provide accurate information in your profile</li>
        <li>Keep your account credentials secure</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You are responsible for all activity under your account.</p>

      <h2>3. Using Guana</h2>
      <p>When using the app, you agree to:</p>
      <ul>

      </ul>

      <h2>4. Rides and Payments</h2>
      <p>Drivers set their own prices per seat. Payment arrangements are made directly between drivers and passengers. Guana does not process payments, hold funds, or guarantee any transactions between users.</p>

      <h2>5. Drivers</h2>
      <p>If you offer rides as a driver, you confirm that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You hold a valid driver's license</li>
        <li>Your vehicle is legally registered and insured</li>
        <li>Your vehicle is in safe operating condition</li>
        <li>You will follow all applicable traffic laws</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Liability</h2>
      <p>Guana is a platform that connects users. We are not responsible for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The conduct of any driver or passenger</li>
        <li>The safety or condition of any vehicle</li>
        <li>Any disputes between users regarding payments or rides</li>
        <li>Any loss, injury, or damage that occurs during a ride</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Users participate in rides at their own risk.</p>

      <h2>7. Content</h2>
      <p>You retain ownership of content you share on Guana (photos, messages, trip listings). By posting content, you grant us a license to display it within the app for the purpose of providing the service.</p>

      <h2>8. Account Termination</h2>
      <p>You may delete your account at any time. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms or that are involved in harmful behavior.</p>

      <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these terms from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes through the app. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
